How to run:
Migrate: cd backend && npm run migrate
Start back-end: cd backend && npm run start
Start front-end: cd frontend && npm run dev

You should be able to find dummy users list in backend/src/db/user.ts

Todos:
- Front-end validation
- Back-end validation
- Only expose receiver and cc list to appropriate users.
- Only allow detail view get request for authorized users.
- UI improvements.

I only spent 2 hours on this project so there are a lot of improvement opportunities here.
